gRPC Tutorial for Client and Server
Welcome to this gRPC tutorial repository, where you'll learn how to implement gRPC for both the client and server sides of your applications. This tutorial also includes practical examples using fake data for products and demonstrates the integration of gRPC with a background service for managing static fields.

Overview
This repository provides step-by-step guidance on using gRPC to create client and server applications. gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) framework that makes it easy to build efficient and robust distributed systems.

Features
Client and server-side implementation of gRPC.
Integration of fake data for product-related examples.
Demonstrates the use of background services to manage static fields.
Getting Started
To use this tutorial, it's important to follow these steps in the recommended order:

Server Side:

Navigate to the server directory.
Follow the instructions provided in the server-side README to set up and run the gRPC server.
Client Side:

Once the server is up and running, navigate to the client directory.
Follow the instructions provided in the client-side README to create and run the gRPC client application.
By following this order, you'll ensure that the client can successfully communicate with the server. Enjoy the tutorial!
